## Reflection
Reflection is a set of language and library features that allows for
introspecting the structure of your own program at runtime. Kotlin makes
functions and properties first-class citizens in the language, and introspecting
them (i.e. learning a name or a type of a property or function at runtime) is
closely intertwined with simply using a functional or reactive style.
